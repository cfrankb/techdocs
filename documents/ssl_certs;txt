You can get a free code signing certificate from Certum if you're doing open source development.
I've been using their certificate for over a year, and it does get rid of the unknown publisher message from Windows.
As far as signing code I use signtool.exe from a script like this:
signtool.exe sign /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll /f "MyCert.pfx" /p MyPassword /d SignedFile.exe SignedFile.exe
