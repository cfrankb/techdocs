[B]Brief Description[/B]

A free all-in-one game construction kit targeted to be both powerful yet simple to use.  Provide an easy way to allow users to create just about any kind of games. We have selected a scripting language to expose engine functionality and allow users to extend the construction kit as needed. LGCK strives to be a compromise between fast execution and ease of use.

[B]Target Aim[/B]

We're looking for people who want to help us create a demo game to promote the construction kit. We need 2D artists for background, art and sprites. Pixel is our first choice but 3D to 2D modelers are welcome too. If you can help us with branding (logos, icons, look & feel) that would be a good addition as well.
