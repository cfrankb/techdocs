The loading mechanism can be configured through the QT_OPENGL environment variable and the following application attributes:

    Qt::AA_UseDesktopOpenGL Equivalent to setting QT_OPENGL to desktop.
    Qt::AA_UseOpenGLES Equivalent to setting QT_OPENGL to angle.
    Qt::AA_UseSoftwareOpenGL Equivalent to setting QT_OPENGL to software.

When a certain configuration is requested explicitly, no checks are done at application startup, that is, the system-provided opengl32.dll will not be examined.
