OBJECT PATHS
------------

QString CObject::m_pathList[] = {
    "Up",  
    "Down",
    "Left",
    "Right",
    "Up Left", // 4
    "Up Right",
    "Down Left",
    "Down Right",
    "Jump Up",  // 8
    "Jump Down",
    "Jump Left",
    "Jump Right",
    "Jump Up Left", // c
    "Jump Up Right",
    "Jump Down Left",
    "Jump Down Right"
};

Definition: a sequence of movements that is to be executed by an object 
during game play.


EXECUTION MODE
--------------

0- Absolute: this object will travel the path regardless of constraints

1- conditional: this object will not travel paths that are blocked. simply
moved on to the next movement defined

2- pending: this object will wait until path is clear to pursue.

3- dead stop: this object will stop execution of the path upon encountering 
an obstacle

  
PATH BLOCK
----------

A path block is a group of paths assigned to an object.


PATH TYPE
---------

A path can be persistent or temporary. Temporary paths are assigned at runtime and 
usually destroyed upon completion. An example would be the player jumping.


DEFAULT / CURRENT PATH
----------------------

This is path as part of the group which the object is following at the moment. 
The value will be -1 if no path is assigned


EVENT SCRIPTING
---------------

Events can fired during the execution of the path way.
(this is going to be for the second version)


LUA SCRIPTING
-------------

setObjectPath(ObjId)
int getObjectPath(ObjId)
int addPath(ObjId, array pathData)
blah
